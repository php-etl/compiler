## Context

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are essential for documenting significant architectural decisions in the Gyroscops Compiler project. As the project grows and evolves, we need a standardized process for creating, maintaining, and managing ADRs to ensure consistency, traceability, and effective communication of architectural decisions across the development team.

This ADR establishes the foundational guidelines for how ADRs should be managed within the project, serving as the meta-ADR that governs all other architectural decision records.

## Decision

### 1. ADR Structure and Organization

#### 1.1 File Location and Naming
- **Decision**: All ADRs must be stored in the `architecture/` directory at the project root
- **Naming Convention**: `ADR{number}-{short-title}.md`
  - Numbers are zero-padded to 3 digits (e.g., `ADR000`, `ADR001`, `ADR042`)
  - Short titles use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
  - Examples: `ADR000-adr-management-process.md`, `ADR001-maintenance-guidelines.md`

#### 1.2 ADR Numbering
- **Decision**: Sequential numbering starting from ADR000
- **ADR000**: Reserved for this ADR management process document
- **ADR001+**: Assigned sequentially for each new architectural decision
- **Retired Numbers**: Numbers are never reused, even if an ADR is superseded or deprecated

#### 1.3 Directory Structure
```
architecture/
├── ADR000-adr-management-process.md
├── ADR001-maintenance-guidelines.md
├── ADR002-{next-decision}.md
└── README.md (index of all ADRs)
```

### 2. ADR Template and Format

#### 2.1 Required Sections
Every ADR must include the following sections in order:

1. **Title**: `# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - {Descriptive Title}`
2. **Header**: ADR number, status, date, authors, reviewers
3. **Context**: Background and problem statement
4. **Decision**: The architectural decision and its rationale
5. **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
6. **Compliance**: Implementation guidelines (if applicable)
7. **Review and Updates**: Review schedule and update process
8. **References**: External links and related documents (if applicable)

#### 2.2 Status Values
- **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet approved
- **Active**: Approved and currently in effect
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (reference the superseding ADR)
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but not yet replaced
- **Rejected**: Considered but not approved

#### 2.3 Metadata Format
```markdown
**Status:** {Status}  
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}  
**Authors:** {Author Names}  
**Reviewers:** {Reviewer Names}  
**Supersedes:** {ADRXXX} (if applicable)  
**Superseded by:** {ADRXXX} (if applicable)
```

### 3. ADR Lifecycle Management

#### 3.1 Creation Process
1. **Identify Need**: Recognize the need for an architectural decision
2. **Draft ADR**: Create draft with status "Proposed"
3. **Assign Number**: Get next sequential ADR number
4. **Team Review**: Circulate for team discussion and feedback
5. **Approval**: Obtain approval from project maintainers
6. **Activation**: Change status to "Active" and merge to main branch

#### 3.2 Review and Update Process
- **Regular Reviews**: ADRs should be reviewed quarterly or when circumstances change
- **Update Procedure**: 
  - Minor updates (clarifications, formatting): Direct edit with commit message
  - Major changes: Create new ADR that supersedes the original
- **Review Date**: Each ADR should specify "Next Review Date"

#### 3.3 Superseding Process
1. Create new ADR with updated decision
2. Update old ADR status to "Superseded" with reference to new ADR
3. Update new ADR metadata to reference superseded ADR
4. Maintain both documents for historical reference

### 4. Content Guidelines

#### 4.1 Writing Standards
- **Language**: Clear, concise, and professional English
- **Audience**: Technical team members and stakeholders
- **Perspective**: Present tense for current decisions, past tense for historical context
- **Objectivity**: Present facts and rationale objectively

#### 4.2 Decision Documentation
- **Rationale**: Always explain why the decision was made
- **Alternatives**: Document considered alternatives and why they were rejected
- **Trade-offs**: Clearly articulate the trade-offs involved
- **Implementation**: Provide concrete implementation guidance when applicable

#### 4.3 Context Requirements
- **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the problem being solved
- **Constraints**: Document any technical, business, or organizational constraints
- **Assumptions**: State any assumptions made during the decision process
- **Stakeholders**: Identify who is affected by the decision

### 5. Governance and Approval

#### 5.1 Approval Authority
- **Project Maintainers**: Final approval authority for all ADRs
- **Technical Leads**: Can approve ADRs within their domain
- **Team Consensus**: Encourage team discussion before formal approval

#### 5.2 Review Requirements
- **Minimum Review Period**: 48 hours for team feedback
- **Required Reviewers**: At least 2 project maintainers
- **Documentation**: Review comments and decisions must be documented

#### 5.3 Dispute Resolution
- **Discussion**: Encourage open discussion of disagreements
- **Escalation**: Escalate unresolved disputes to project leadership
- **Documentation**: Document dissenting opinions in the ADR

### 6. Tools and Automation

#### 6.1 ADR Index Maintenance
- **README.md**: Maintain an index of all ADRs in `architecture/README.md`
- **Status Tracking**: Include current status of each ADR in the index
- **Automatic Updates**: Consider automation for index maintenance

#### 6.2 Template Usage
- **Standard Template**: Provide a template file for new ADRs
- **Validation**: Consider automated validation of ADR format
- **Tooling**: Explore tools for ADR management and visualization
